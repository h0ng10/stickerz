# STICKERZ

A simple messaging app that is purposely vulnerable. It should NOT be used in a production environment. Stickerz is used as a playground for the "penetrationt testing course"
at the University of Applied Siences Ulm.

### Installation
Stickers is based on Python 3/Flask, you can use a virtual environment to run it

```
# Install Python3/pip in a virtual environment "venv", this keeps your installation clean
virtualenv -p python3 venv

# Start the virtual environment
source venv/bin/active

# Install Flask
pip install flask

# run the application
python app.py

```

You can then access the application at TCP port 5000.
